These are repositories of some of my personal and university projects, including:
   - An implementation of AlphaZero for Connect 4
   - Reinforcement Learning for racetrack curve optimization
   - Heuristics for the Weighted Editing S-Plex problem
   - k-Minimum Spanning Tree through MILP Optimization
   - Vocabulary app for German learners
   - Letterboxd user comparison dashboard
   - Groups and projects optimizer
   - Simplex implementation
